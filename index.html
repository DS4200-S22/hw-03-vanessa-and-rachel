                The size of the bubble marker represents a quantitative and sequential attribute, 
                the % of pie represents a quantitative and sequential attribute, the pie slices represent categorical attributes,
                and the x-axis and y-axis represent quantitative and sequential attributes. The visualization uses area as its marks and
                position (horizontal and vertical), color, tilt, and size (area) as its channels. Area, which is an item/node,
                is displayed by the two-dimentionality of the pies. Position, which is an identity, is displayed through the 
                x- and y- coordinates of the pies. Color, which is an identity, is displayed by the varying colors of the slices 
                in each pie. Tilt, which is a magnitude, is displayed through the pie slices in the pies. Size, which is a magnitude,
                is displayed the varying areas of the pies.

            <p>
                The nodes in each line represent items, and the edges connecting a node to another represent links. The ranks (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                represent ordinal and sequential attributes. The labels (e.g. A, B, C, D, E) corresponding to the lines represent a categorical
                attribute. The years represent ordinal and sequential attributes. The visualization uses points and lines as its marks and position
                (horizontal and vertical) and color as its channels. Points, which are items/nodes, are displayed by the nodes. Lines, which are
                items/nodes, are displayed through the edges. Position, which is an identity, is displayed through the ranks and years. Color, which
                is an identity, is displayed through the labels (e.g. A, B, C, D, E).

                Each idea node represents an item, and the edges branching an idea to another represent links. The visualization uses area and lines
                as its marks and color as its channel. Area, which is an item/node, is displayed through the two-dimentionality of each idea. Lines,
                which are items/nodes, are displayed through the edges branching from an idea to another. Color, which is an identity, is displayed
                by the varying categories of ideas.

        <div class="chart">

            <p>
                The y-axis represents quantitative and sequential attributes. The x-axis represents categorical attributes. The stacked datasets represent
                categorical attributes. The visualization uses area as its mark and color, position (vertical), and size (area) as its channels. Area,
                which is an item/node, is displayed through the two-dimensionality of the bars. Color, which is an identity, is displayed through the
                varying stacks within each bar for subcategories. Position, which is an identity, is displayed through the heights at which the stacks or bars
                reach. Size, which is a magnitude, is displayed through the lengths of the stacks and bars.
